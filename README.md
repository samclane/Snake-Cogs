 # Snake-Cogs
Cogs repo for my personal Red-Bot discord installation. 


To add cogs, use ```[p]cog repo add snake-cogs https://github.com/samclane/Snake-Cogs```

Check if there are any dependancies, and install them using pip3

## Cog Overview

**Damn-Dog** - Play the damn.dog Wikihow trivia game right from your discord!

**on_join** - Uses gTTS to announce when a user joins the channel, like Teamspeak or Ventrillo

**network_tool** - Cog that updates a webpage with diagnostic info. Currently on a shaky first-release. 


## Wiki
https://github.com/samclane/Snake-Cogs/wiki

The wiki is up. I currently only have the command helps up, but I'll be adding more cog info as I see fit.
