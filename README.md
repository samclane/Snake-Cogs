 # Snake-Cogs
Cogs repo for my personal Red-Bot discord installation. 


To add cogs, use ```[p]cog repo add snake-cogs https://github.com/samclane/Snake-Cogs```

Check if there are any dependencies, and install them using pip3

## Cog Overview

**DamnDog** - Play the damn.dog Wikihow trivia game right from your Discord chat!

**OnJoin** - Uses gTTS to announce when a user joins the channel, like Teamspeak or Ventrillo.

**NetworkTool** - Cog that updates a webpage with diagnostic info, sent via websocket.

The wiki is up. I currently only have the command helps up, but I'll be adding more cog info as I see fit.
